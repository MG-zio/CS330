Projects from my comp graphic and visual design class at SNHU.


**Course Reflection**
- How do I approach designing software?

My first step when I approach the development of a system is to make goals for the project before making any code. In these projects, I made a list of each requirement a scene had and used that to inform my design. This method allowed me to have a metric for success so I could know when I was done.


- How do I approach developing programs?

While developing programs I write tests whenever I finish a section of code. I check at consistent intervals whether what I have written is working and whether I think it could be better. When making a 3D scene, this meant testing things like the lighting over and over again getting feedback from myself or others about what could be improved. I also use comments consistently to help me understand what the code I'm looking at does. I try not to overcomment my code however, as I believe code should be able to be comprehended without comments if it is properly written. In projects with other people I will write comments for others (or myself if I've forgotten) which explain what the function of the code block ahead is.


- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Learning computer science helps me in achieving my goal of becoming a software engineer. My courses so far have taught me a lot not just about how to code in different languages, but also systematic approaches to problems in software development. I have taken to heart the breakdown of problems into smaller parts and solving one at a time. Its also taught me a lot about data structures and the algorithms to traverse them which was not intuitive for me. Computer science has also unexpectedly taught me more about ethics with regards to what and how I program. Being irresponsible with data for example is something that isn't just bad to do, but is a moral failing and can have severe societal impact.
